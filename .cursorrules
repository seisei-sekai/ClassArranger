# Cursor Rules for ClassArranger Project

## Rule 1: Markdown Files Management

**NEVER create markdown files in the root directory.**

- All markdown documentation files MUST be placed in the `docs/` folder
- When creating a new markdown file, include a header with:
  - Creation date
  - Last updated date
  - Purpose/description
- Format:
  ```markdown
  # Document Title
  
  **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
  **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
  **Purpose:** Brief description
  
  ---
  
  [Content]
  ```
- Update `docs/INDEX.md` when creating new documentation files
- Only create markdown files when explicitly requested or necessary for documentation

## Rule 2: Domain Driven Design (DDD)

**Always follow Domain Driven Design principles when writing code.**

- Organize code by business domains (bounded contexts)
- Use domain entities, value objects, and aggregates
- Separate domain logic from infrastructure and presentation layers
- Structure:
  - `domain/` - Business logic and domain models
  - `application/` - Use cases and application services
  - `infrastructure/` - External integrations and data access
  - `api/` or `presentation/` - API routes and UI components

## Rule 3: Keep Rules Concise

**Keep cursor rules brief and focused.**

- Avoid verbose explanations
- Focus on essential guidelines only
- Let code patterns emerge from practice

## Rule 4: All the Annotation should be in English

**All the Annotation should be in English**

- If there is Adding Chinese or Japanese Annotation, Please also add a english version in the following place.


## Rule 5: Operate by Best Practices

**All operations must follow best practices.**

- Do not automatically execute or implement any operation if it does not adhere to best practices.
- Do not document non-best-practice operations in any markdown file.
- Evaluate actions for adherence to current best practices before proceeding.
